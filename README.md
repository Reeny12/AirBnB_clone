Airbnb is a well-known online platform that allows individuals to list, discover, and book lodging accommodations around the world. It was founded in 2008 and has since become a popular option for travelers seeking unique and often more affordable alternatives to traditional hotels.

Hosts can use Airbnb to rent out their spare rooms, entire homes, apartments, or other types of accommodations to guests on a short-term basis. Guests can browse listings, read reviews, and book accommodations directly through the platform. Airbnb has expanded beyond just lodging, with some hosts offering experiences, such as guided tours, workshops, and activities, to further enhance the travel experience.
